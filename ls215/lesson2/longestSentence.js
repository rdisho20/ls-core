  split the string into sentences

  for each sentence
    split the sentence into words
    count the amount of words

    If the word count is greater than the current largest word count
      set the largest word count equal to current word count
      set the largest sentence equal to the current sentence
  
  log sentence and word count to the console

-Question...
How to preserve sentence ending punctuation?
find starting index, slice up to index + count + 1 (plus one grabs punctuation)
