# Method Resolution Order

Method resolution order is the order in which Python searches up the heirarchy 
of classes and their corresponding MixIns in order to know which method to call.

MRO is important, because knowing the order allows us to construct class heirarchies
appropriately knowing what to expect when we call whichever methods on our 
object instances or classes.
